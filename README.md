# python-mysql-doyin-connect-api
A Python API to connect Python to MYSQL Database and execute SQL statements. It automatically installs 'mysql-connector-python' if not already installed

# Addendum
I also recently added a new file 'MYSQL-Python-Connection-Youtube-File.ipyb' in order to get the breakdown of the intuition behind the class operations, for beginner programmers to understand the concept.

Also, as reference for my lovely youtube channel viewers and subscribers.
